My first foray into Python programming. Just needed a small but simple program to pull all links from a websites.
Made small as possible for termux.

To install in termux, you must have git and python3 installed already.

pkg install git

Clone allyourlink
git clone https://github.com/reallock/allyourlink.git

cd allyourlink

pip install -r requirements.txt

To execute allyourlink
python3 allyourlink.py
